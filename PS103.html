    <h1>PS103 Final: Criminal Justice System</h1>
    <p>
I chose to examine the US criminal justice system which I found to be more interesting than my previous topic I chose. The criminal justice system is controversial across the spectrum of political leanings for different reasons. Within the US there is a high prison population relative to the rest of the world. I'll be examining the issue and hoping to decipher this complicated issue.
    </p>
        <h1><b>Jim Crow Weaponizing The Legal System</b></h1>
    <p>
Several factors contribute to the enormous prison population as well as the prison demographics and can’t be pinpointed to one cause. Political leaning affects the perception of the cause of the issue. The first domino of the controversial history of the criminal justice system started in 1865 with the beginning of the Jim Crow era in the southern United States. The political leaders in the south decided to implement a racist system to oppress minorities through lawful means in retaliation for losing the ability to keep slaves. The biased criminal justice system in the southern United States led to the first uptick in prison population. This also presents the idea: slavery may have been outlawed but forcing prisoners to do labor effectively brought back slavery. Prisons using modern slavery to bring in profits have begun. Prisoners are paid significantly below the federal minimum wage nowadays making well under 1$ per hour of work. Establishment of the Federal Prison Industries in 1934 and the Prison Industry Enhancement Certification Program in 1979 codified and regulated prison labor. Dubbed the Prison-Industrial system.

        <h1><b>Modern Slavery</b></h1>
    <p>
Starting in 1970 till its peak in 2009 the prison population went from just under 200,000 to just over 1.4 million. If the prison population was it’s own city it would be the 8th largest city in the United States by population today with almost 10% of them being in a private for profit prison. Private prisons are incentivized to maximize profits by keeping people in at the same time decentivized from providing programs to help prisoners adjust to normal life after serving their sentence. States are enticed to change to private prisons due to lowering overall program cost but these come with unintended consequences. Private prisons have undoubtedly shown they’re more efficient and cost effective when it comes to housing prisoners but one of the methods utilized is reducing overhead by reducing accountability as well as a reduction of programs to help prisoners instead they try to use inmates as cheap labor. Private prisons place profit over rehabilitating prisoners, incentivizing judges to impose harsher sentences on people and even lobby the government to change policies that benefit them. The previous issues are not very concerning for the average citizen but there are also much more sinister consequences of prison privation, in 2008 two Pennsylvania judges were convicted on racketeering charges. Judges Michael Conahan and Mark Ciavarella were in the middle of the “Kids for Cash” scandal. These two judges were given compensation for harshly convicting or extending sentences to juveniles at a for profit juvenile detention center. Thousands of juveniles were victims of these two judges. How many times has this happened without the judges being caught?

        <h1><b>The Beginning of The War On Drugs</b></h1>
    <p>
Starting in 1968 the United States government’s attitude toward drugs changed. During Nixon’s administration he stated drugs were public enemy number one. Starting in 1970 there was a sharp rise every year since then in the prison population. The DEA was formed in 1973. They enacted a tough on drugs policy. The early 1980s saw the surge in crack usage and a crack epidemic across the United States as a result to combat the rising drug use police went after drug users and traffickers more aggressively. Nonviolent drug incarations increased from 50,000 yearly in 1980 to nearly half a million in 1997. The war on drugs in the 1980s gave birth to another controversial law. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 established mandatory minimums for sentencing. Possession of 5 grams of crack requires a minimum of 5 years prison sentence. Because crack was primarily isolated to the black community with 80% of users being African American resulted in primarily African American men being arrested. During this time the prison population reached over 30% being black with roughly another 30% being hispanic, the prison was majority minority, in certain aspects, by design. Was the government’s aggressive sentencing because of how dangerous the drug is or because of who the users are?
